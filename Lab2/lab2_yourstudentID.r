#Part1 vector (10%)
#(a) should return 26852735
# Type your code here



#(b) should return 2129170437
# Type your code here


#part2 matrices (10%)
# Type your code here



#The brackets round the first line ensure the matrix ( tmp<-matrix()) is displayed so that we can check that it has been
#entered correctly.
#using multiplication (*)


# or using crossprod 


#part3 (80%)

# create variable speed, occupancy, volume with c()



# create variable 'dtbind'  that combines speed, occupancy and volume using cbind() 

#Then check whether 'dtbind' is a matrix

#create data frame from the variable that you have created above, store to a new variable, called  "dtfrm" 


#read dataset use read.table() 
# before that, type getwd() to show your current working directory path and setwd("your file path") to set your path


#read dataset use read.csv()


#check your data correctness using names(), str(), dim(), head()


#why dimenssion dtfrm1 and dtfrm2 different?

#Compute the following: how many observations were made ?


#compute mean 'speed', mean'volume' without removing missing value NA (without na.rm=TRUE)


#Create new dataset called 'trafficData' with removing NA 
#na.omit(your.data.frame)


#compute mean 'speed', mean 'volume' again (in dataset trafficData)
